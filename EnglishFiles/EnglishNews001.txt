Wagner mercenary group founder Yevgeny Prigozhin was assassinated, probably on the orders of longtime partron Vladimir Putin, the US said, and assertion the Kremlin denied. Prigozhin and his No. 2 were among 10 people assumed killed in what intelligence officials contend was likely a midair explosion and subsequent crash of his plane. Prigozhin's demise happened to occur exactly two months after his aborted march on Moscos. In his first comments on the crash, Putin said his former ally-turned-mutineer was "a man with a complicated fate." As the Kremlin leader continues his brutal and flailing war on Ukraine, Prigozhin's death may have shorted up his wavering reputation as unchallengeable.
美国称，瓦络纳雇佣军组织创始人叶夫根尼-普里戈金被暗杀，很可能是长期靠山弗拉基米尔-普京的指使，克里姆林宫否认了这一说法。情报官员认为，普里戈金的飞机很可能在空中爆炸，随后坠毁，普里戈金和他的副手是假定遇难的 10 人之一。普里戈金的死亡恰好发生在他放弃进军莫斯科后的两个月。普京在首次就坠机事件发表评论时说，他的前盟友转变成叛乱者，“他的命运很复杂”。在克里姆林宫领导人继续对乌克兰发动残暴和毫无章法的战争之际，普里戈金的死可能巩固了他不可挑战的动摇的声誉。
