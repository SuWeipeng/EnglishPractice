If you find this recording,

don't feel bad about this.

Part of the journey is the end.

Just for the record,

being adrift in space with zero,

promise of rescue is more fun than it sounds.

Food and water ran out four days ago.

Oxygen will run out tomorrow morning.

That will be it.

When I drift off I will dream about you.

It's always you.
