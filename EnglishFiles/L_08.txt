Hey. How'd the interview go?

Ugh. I blew it. 

I wouldn't have even hired me.

Oh. Come here, sweetie.

Listen. You're going to go on, like,

a thousend interviews before you get a job.

That's not how that was supposed to come out.

This is just the worst Christmas ever.

You know what, Rach, 

maybe you should just, you know, 

stay here at the coffee house.

I can't. It's too late.

Terry already hired that girl over there.

Look at her.

She's even got waitress experience. Ugh.
